                <p class="text-secondary">
                    The term “organic” refers to the way agricultural products are grown and processed. While the regulations vary from country to country, in the U.S., organic crops must be grown must be grown without the use of synthetic herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers,
                    or bioengineered genes.
                </p><br>

                <p class="text-secondary">
                    Organic livestock raised for meat, eggs, and dairy products must be raised in living conditions accommodating their natural behaviors (such as the ability to graze on pasture) and fed organic feed and forage. They may not be given antibiotics, growth
                    hormones, or any animal by-products.
                </p>

                <h3>The benefits of organic food</h3><br>
                <p>How your food is grown or raised can have a major impact on your mental and emotional health as well as the environment. Organic foods often have more beneficial nutrients, such as antioxidants, than their conventionally-grown counterparts
                    and people with allergies to foods, chemicals, or preservatives may find their symptoms lessen or go away when they eat only organic foods.</p><br>

                <p><span>Organic produce contains fewer pesticides.</span> Chemicals such as synthetic fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides are widely used in conventional agriculture and residues remain on (and in) the food we eat.
                </p><br>

                <p><span>Organic food is often fresher</span> because it doesn’t contain preservatives that make it last longer. Organic produce is sometimes (but not always, so watch where it is from) produced on smaller farms nearer to where it is sold.
                </p><br>

                <p><span>Organic farming tends to be better for the environment.</span> Feeding livestock animal byproducts increases the risk of mad cow disease (BSE) and the use of antibiotics can create antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Organically-raised
                    animals tend to be given more space to move around and access to the outdoors, which help to keep them healthy.
                </p><br>

                <p><span>Organically raised animals are NOT given antibiotics, growth hormones, or fed animal byproducts.</span> Organic farming practices may reduce pollution, conserve water, reduce soil erosion, increase soil fertility, and use less energy.
                    Farming without synthetic pesticides is also better for nearby birds and animals as well as people who live close to farms.
